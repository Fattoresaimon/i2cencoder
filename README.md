# The I2C encoder V1 and V2 are not compatible. If you have the V2 please go in the correct [repository](https://github.com/Fattoresaimon/I2CEncoderV2)

## Introduction

The I2C Encoder is a small board where you can use a classical mechanical encoder with a I2C bus. This device
includes also the possibility to add a bi-color LED and user can set luminosity through the I2C bus. Itâ€™s possible to connect up
to 16 boards in cascade and read all of them with the same I2C bus.
The I2C Encoder have a series of 8 bit registers where it is possible to configure the parameters and three 32
bit of registers. The 32 bit registers are the most important because they store the counter value, the maximum
and minimum threshold. Every time when the encoder is moved at least one step, the counter value is increased or
decreased according to the rotation direction. When the counter value is outside of the limit set by the threshold,
the counter value can be wrapped or can stuck on the threshold valued reached.
The I2C Encoder also has an open-drain interrupt pin. It is set to logic low every time when the encoder is rotated
or pushed. The status register must be read by the master to check what is changed.

## HW version 1.2
* Resolved the I2C pull-up resistor issue.
* Removed pull-up and anti bouncing filter on the push-button. The MCU pull-up are used and the  anti bouncing is done in FW.
